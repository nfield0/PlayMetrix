PostgreSQL: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

Backend - 
Python (3.11.5): https://www.python.org/downloads/

Frontend -
Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

# Installation & Running
### Install & Setup Database first, then install & run Backend in it's own terminal, and finally install & run Front-end in a separate terminal.


## Database: 
#### Go to PostgreSQL website and download the latest
#### Select your OS and version of PostgreSQL
#### Once installed, open PgAdmin4
#### Add a master password, and remember this as it will be used to run backend later.

### Run the code contained in playmetrixV2.sql to create the database and tables


## Backend:

### To run install automatically, click run button in main.py file. Accept prompt to create Virtual Environment.



### Manual Code setup
> Create a Virtual Environment on Windows (Ctrl + Shift + P in VSCode)
```
python -m venv .venv
```
> Create a Virtual Environment on MacOS
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
> Run Virtual Environment
```
.venv/scripts/activate
```
> Install Requirement libraries
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Create a new file in your project directory and name it .env. Insert this text inside:
```
DB_CONNECTION = "postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/yourdatabasename"
```
> Run Backend (Uvicorn)
```
python -m uvicorn Backend.main:app --reload
```
## Backend Testing: 
> Run in new terminal
```
python -m pytest
```
